Hello! :) 👋🏽 I’m one term away from graduating from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor in Computational Math 🤖 & a minor in Computing and Psychology! 🧠

During my undergraduate degree, I’ve discovered a deep passion for brain health and have been researching new ways we can employ tech to improve and better care for our brains :) I love investigating new therapies that combine computational and neuroscientific methods to enhance our understanding of our brains and improve overall cognition. 📈

I’m currently working on a photobiomodulation research project 👩🏽‍🔬 at Baycrest's Rotman Research Institute in Toronto and will continue working with them after I graduate!
